        Refund and Cancellation policy

    <p class="text-sm mx-8">
        This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek
        a refund for a product / service that you have purchased through the
        Platform. Under this policy: Cancellations will only be considered if
        the request is made 30 days of placing the order. However, cancellation
        requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to
        such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have
        initiated the process of shipping them, or the product is out for
        delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the
        doorstep. Outlandish Land does not accept cancellation requests for
        perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, the refund /
        replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality of the
        product delivered is not good. In case of receipt of damaged or
        defective items, please report to our customer service team. The request
        would be entertained once the seller/ merchant listed on the Platform,
        has checked and determined the same at its own end. This should be
        reported within 30 days of receipt of products. In case you feel that
        the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your
        expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service
        within 30 days of receiving the product. The customer service team after
        looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision. In case
        of complaints regarding the products that come with a warranty from the
        manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In case of any refunds
        approved by Outlandish Land, it will take 15 days for the refund to be
        processed to you.
