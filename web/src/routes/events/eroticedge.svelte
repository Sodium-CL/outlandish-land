                Erotic Edge is a film festival conducted by Kinky Collective.
                Kinky Collective is based out of India and works on spreading
                awareness about kink and build a healthy community of kinky and
                sex-positive people in India. The screening is limited to
                audience who are part of the community or want to be part of the
                community - based on their interest and motivation to attend the
                screening.
