        This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek
        a refund for a product / service that you have purchased through the
        Platform. Under this policy:
        <ul class="list-decimal text-sm mx-8">
            <li>
                Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made 30
                days of placing the order / buying the ticket.
            </li>
            <li>
                The request would be entertained only if the seller/ merchant
                listed on the platform offers refund on Cancellation.
            </li>
            <li>
                In case of any refunds approved by Outlandish Land, it will take
